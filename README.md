**PrivacyGuardian** is a Security AI Agent that analyzes PDF documents for potential sensitive data leaks and information security risks through the **SenecaLLM** artificial intelligence model, which is developed specifically for cybersecurity. The tool extracts text from PDF files (either local files or via a web URL) and then uses advanced LLM models to provide a detailed analysis of the documentâ€™s content. It detects confidential information such as passwords, tokens, API keys, personally identifiable information (PII), and hard-coded credentials, and evaluates whether sharing the document with third parties may pose any risk. It provides users with the analysis results along with recommendations.

## Features

- **PDF Analysis:**  
  Supports both local PDF files and PDF documents accessed via web URLs.

- **LLM Integration:**  
  Leverages Seneca LLM models for security analysis. Users can choose between:
  1. `AlicanKiraz0/Seneca-x-DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-v1.3-Safe`
  2. `AlicanKiraz0/SenecaLLM-x-Llama3.1-8B`

- **Quantization Options:**  
  Offers optional 4-bit or 8-bit quantization (using [bitsandbytes](https://github.com/TimDettmers/bitsandbytes)) to optimize model performance.
